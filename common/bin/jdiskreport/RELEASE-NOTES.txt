
                   JDiskReport Version 1.3.1
                         Release Notes

  This maintenance update fixes a bug with recent Java 6 versions,
  looks slightly better on Vista, and comes with improved support
  for the Windows application data directory (%APPDATA%).
  
  On the Mac the "/Volumes" directory is not excluded by default.
  Hence, external drives can be scanned without changing the filter.
  On the other hand, external drives will be scanned and listed,
  if you scan the root directory "/".
  
  Slightly improved dialog design. Fixed duplicate mnemonics, fixed
  broken radio menu item mnemonics, style guide compliant mnemonics,
  added a few menu accelerators.

                   JDiskReport Version 1.3.0
                         Release Notes


INTRODUCTION

  This maintenance update comes with a slightly polished main window
  and behaves better on Windows Vista.
  
  Previous versions created a folder ".jdiskreport" in the user home
  directory, which was rarely used by Windows users. On Windows Vista
  the "Users\<user name>\" directory is visited more frequently, and
  a ".jdiskreport" directory may annoy users.   
  The JDiskReport folder is now created under the %APPDATA% directory,
  if available, otherwise under the user home directory - as before.
  
  
OTHER CHANGES

  o Uses the most recent JGoodies open source libraries.
  o Moved header label to the frame title prefix.
  o Removed status bar and some borders.
  o Larger pie chart.
  o Runtime resources have been reorganized.
